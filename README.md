===============================

##Assumptions :-
1. The number of sides of polygon and star is assumed to be 13.
2. The universal point will be set back to (0,5) after user presses 'c' i.e. clear screen operation.
3. The initial size of the edges of polynomial has been set to 3 so that it is visible to the user.
4. The initial size of the point has been set to 4 so that it is visible to the user from where he will start drawing any figure.
5. Window size has been set to 'screen width' X 'screen height' of the device which can later be changed by user by resizing the window.
6. The default color for any figure is set black. Once a user chooses a different color for any figure it would remain same for all unless changed again by user. 


##Platform :-
1. The source code has been written in windows using Visual studio 2015 community edition.
2. The package used for Glut library is nupengl.core.0.1.0.1 which was the only one available in Visual Studio 2015 although the code should run on any platform on any implementation of GLUT.

##Other :-
1. All code present in main.cpp in PolyLineDrawer folder.
2. The solution file may be incompatible with older version of visual studio.
3. The source code will run correctly if copied into a new WIN32 project in the older versions of visual studio.
